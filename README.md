# Accessibility Restructure

## Description
This project includes html and css code that has been edited for legilibity, efficiency, and accessibility. This creates an example of using semantic html elements to make your code easier to read and more efficiently styled in the attached css sheet. The appearance of the webpage has not been altered from the starter code, but the html and css files have been restructured and comments, a page title, and alt attributes for images have been added to make both the code and the webpage more accessible to designers and users. Starter code that was altered has been put into comments to illustrate the changes made.
